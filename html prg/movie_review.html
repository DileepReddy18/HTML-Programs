    <h1>Movie Review</h1>
    <img src="kalki.jpeg" alt="kalki" width="200px" height="300px">
    <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Rating: </b>3.9/5.0</p>
    <p><b>Movie Name: </b>Kalki 2898 AD</p>
    <p><b>Release Date: </b>June 27, 2024</p>
    <p><b>Starring: </b>Prabhas, Deepika Padukone, Amitabh Bachchan,
         Kamal Haasan, Rajendra Prasad, Disha Patani, Saswata Chatterjee,
          Brahmanandam, Anna Ben, Shobana, Mrunal Thakur, Dulquer Salmaan,
           Vijay Deverakonda, and others.</p>
    <p><b>Director: </b>Nag Ashwin</p>
    <p><b>Producer: </b> Aswini Dutt, Priyanka Dutt and Swapna Dutt</p>
    <p><b>Music Director: </b>Santhosh Narayanan</p>
    <p><b>Cinematographer: </b>Djordie Stojilikovic</p>
    <p><b>Editor: </b>Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao</p>
    <p><b>Plus Points: </b>Tollywood’s ‘Darling,’ Prabhas, steals the show as Bhairava, a bounty hunter with a quirky nature, 
        humour, greed, and cunning personality. He nails Nag Ashwin’s vision for the lead role. Prabhas fits the Bhairava character 
        perfectly, and his scenes with his digital companion Bujji (voiced by Keerthy Suresh) are a delight. The futuristic car, 
        integral to the narrative, dazzles during the film’s monumental scenes. Prabhas’ other role is a surprise one needs to experience 
        on the big screen only.</p>
    <p><b>Minus Points: </b>Despite its captivating second half, the film’s slow-paced first half can be challenging. The director and editor 
        could have trimmed the film’s length by cutting scenes that add little value.</p>
        <p>The scenes between Prabhas and Disha Patani lack engagement, and the song set in Complex feels unnecessary.</p>
    <p><b>Technical Aspects: </b>Nag Ashwin excels as both writer and director, bringing his vision to life with the help of a talented cast and crew.
         However, the screenplay could have been tighter in the first half, matching the gripping climax.</p>
         <p>Djordje Stojiljkovic’s cinematography is outstanding. The editing by Kota Venkateswara Rao is good but could be sharper, particularly in the first hour.
             Cutting unnecessary scenes could have improved the film’s pace.</p>
